# Quick Start: Withdrawal User Feedback System

## What Was Implemented

Your withdrawal system now provides real-time user feedback with human-readable messages. Here's what changed:

### 1. Immediate Response
When a user initiates a withdrawal, they immediately see:
```
"Withdrawal initiated successfully. Transaction is being processed."
```

### 2. Real-Time Status Updates
The frontend polls the server every 3 seconds to check withdrawal status:
- **Processing**: "Your withdrawal is being processed on the blockchain."
- **Completed**: "Withdrawal successful! View on Explorer" (with clickable link)
- **Failed**: Human-readable error like "Network temporarily unavailable. Please try again."

### 3. User-Friendly Error Messages
All technical errors are translated:
- ‚ùå `cURL error 28: Resolving timed out`
- ‚úÖ `Network temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few moments.`

### 4. Technical Logging Preserved
All technical details remain in `storage/logs/laravel.log` for debugging.

## Files Created

### Events & Notifications
- `app/Events/WithdrawalStatusUpdated.php` - Broadcasts status changes
- `app/Notifications/WithdrawalCompleted.php` - Notifies user on success
- `app/Notifications/WithdrawalFailed.php` - Notifies user on failure

### Exception Handling
- `app/Exceptions/BlockchainException.php` - Custom exception with user messages

### Documentation
- `WITHDRAWAL_USER_FEEDBACK_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `ERROR_MESSAGES_REFERENCE.md` - Error mapping reference

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `app/Http/Controllers/WalletController.php`
  - Added `mapExceptionToUserMessage()` method
  - Added `getWithdrawalStatus()` API endpoint
  - Added `getStatusMessage()` helper
  - Updated `processWithdrawal()` to return structured JSON

- `app/Jobs/ProcessBlockchainWithdrawal.php`
  - Added event broadcasting on status changes
  - Added notification sending
  - Enhanced error mapping in `getHumanReadableError()`

- `routes/web.php`
  - Updated withdrawal status API route

### Frontend
- `resources/js/pages/Wallet/Withdraw.tsx`
  - Updated `handleSubmit()` to use axios and handle structured responses
  - Enhanced polling logic to handle new response format
  - Improved error handling

## API Response Structure

All withdrawal endpoints now return:

```json
{
  "status": "processing|completed|failed",
  "message": "User-friendly status message",
  "transaction_id": 123,
  "explorer_url": "https://explorer.solana.com/tx/...",
  "error": "Human-readable error (if failed)"
}
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Start Queue Worker
```bash
php artisan queue:work --queue=withdrawals
```

### 2. Monitor Logs
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### 3. Test Withdrawal Flow
1. Go to `/withdraw` in your browser
2. Fill out withdrawal form
3. Submit
4. Observe:
   - Immediate modal showing "Processing"
   - Status updates every 3 seconds
   - Success message with explorer link (or error message)

### 4. Test Error Scenarios

#### Network Error (simulate)
- Temporarily disconnect internet
- Submit withdrawal
- User sees: "Network temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few moments."

#### Insufficient Balance
- Try to withdraw more than available
- User sees: "Insufficient blockchain balance to complete this withdrawal."

#### Invalid Address
- Enter malformed address
- User sees: "Invalid destination address. Please check and try again."

## Common Error Messages

| User Sees | What Happened |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Network temporarily unavailable..." | RPC timeout or connection issue |
| "Insufficient blockchain balance..." | Not enough funds on-chain |
| "Invalid destination address..." | Address format validation failed |
| "Transaction expired. Please try again." | Blockhash expired |
| "Wallet configuration error..." | Private key decryption failed |

## Optional: Enable WebSocket Broadcasting

For instant updates without polling:

### 1. Install Laravel WebSockets
```bash
composer require beyondcode/laravel-websockets
php artisan websockets:install
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Update `.env`
```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=local
PUSHER_APP_KEY=local
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=local
PUSHER_HOST=127.0.0.1
PUSHER_PORT=6001
PUSHER_SCHEME=http
```

### 3. Start WebSocket Server
```bash
php artisan websockets:serve
```

### 4. Frontend Will Automatically Receive Updates
No polling needed - instant status updates via WebSocket!

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User sees technical error message
**Solution**: Check that error mapping is working in `getHumanReadableError()` method

### Issue: Status not updating
**Solution**: Ensure queue worker is running and check `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Issue: No explorer URL shown
**Solution**: Verify transaction completed successfully and `explorer_url` is set

### Issue: Funds not returned on failure
**Solution**: Check `revertReservedBalance()` is being called in job's `failed()` method

## Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check withdrawal status
SELECT id, user_id, status, failure_reason, explorer_url, created_at, completed_at
FROM transactions
WHERE type = 'withdrawal'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check user notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE notifiable_id = YOUR_USER_ID
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check failed withdrawals
SELECT id, user_id, currency, amount, failure_reason
FROM transactions
WHERE type = 'withdrawal' AND status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with different error scenarios
2. **Monitor logs** to ensure error mapping covers all cases
3. **Add more error patterns** as you discover them
4. **Consider WebSocket** for real-time updates without polling
5. **Customize messages** to match your brand voice

## Support

If you encounter errors not covered by the current mapping:
1. Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for the technical error
2. Add mapping in `getHumanReadableError()` method
3. Test the new message with users
4. Update `ERROR_MESSAGES_REFERENCE.md`
